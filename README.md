## ml - machine learning

This is just a documentation of my learning progress. Inspired by object detection for cars with DarkNet and David's bachelor work at [HCMUTE](http://en.hcmute.edu.vn/) in connection with a car at the end of 2018 I started to learn more about machine learning.

Posenet runs on TensorFlow.lite in a browser on WebGL even on a smartphone. We tested it in December 2018 in Seoul, Korea. In March 2019 I got TensorFlow.js running with my RX470 with 43 fps.

## Schedule

In [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-a-complete-newbie-to-passing-the-tensorflow-developer-certificate-exam-d919e1e5a0f3) Harsheev Desai describes his journey to become a TensorFlow Developer with Certificate in 5 months.

### 1. Learn Python
- [Python bootcamp at udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/)
- [Coursera python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python#courses)
- [List of 10 courses at medium.com](https://medium.com/better-programming/top-5-courses-to-learn-python-in-2018-best-of-lot-26644a99e7ec)

### 2. Learn Machine Learning Theory
 
- [Coursera Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) on Statistics, Calculus and Linear Algebra

### 3. Learn Data Science Libraries

Some of these libraries are Pandas (data manipulation and analysis), Numpy (support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices), Matplotlib (plotting) and Scikitlearn (creating ML models).

### 4. Deep Learning Theory

- [Coursera Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?#courses)
- [Inner workings of DNN in practical implementations](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/what-i-learned-from-building-a-deep-neural-network-from-scratch-and-why-you-should-do-it-too-a2e6f422d3db)

### 5. TensorFlow

- [Coursera TensorFlow in Practice](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice#courses)

One reason for tensorflow can be seen in this graph regarding popularity on stack overflow:

## History

- __February 2020__ The Jetson car is purcheased, Wifi module and 7" display as well. Needs completion - without students due to COVID-19
- __December 2019__ On [hackster.io](https://hackster.io) starts a new competition [AI at the Edge Challenge](https://www.hackster.io/contests/NVIDIA) where you can win a Jetson Nano. I apply and eventually just buy one from [arrow](https://www.arrow.com/)
- __March 2019__ posenet runs in the browser with new RX470 with 43 fps
- __December 2018__ TensorFlow.lite in a browser on my iPhone 7 runs at 6 fps, demonstrated in Seoul
- __October 2018__ Successful installed darknet on ubuntu, object detection works for stills. Not yet webcam or video.
